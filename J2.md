## Question 1
### basic types:
- int a
- double b
### Objects:
- int c[]
- String s

## Question 2
<ol type="a">
  <li>What is a static Method</li>
    <ul>
    <li>A static method in java is a method that works on a static version of the object. </li>
    <li>This means that instead of using a constructor to make an object, and then altering it's values with a method
      You can simply run the method, and it alters the static variables</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Why is the main method static</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The main method needs to be static because there is no object created of the main class</li>
    <li>If you tried to call non static main without calling it on an object it would throw an error</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

## Question 3
 1. Wrong
 2. Correct

## Question 4
- This returns false, since java passes by value and you are attempting to turn a string into a new string, which would change the value, but not any field stored within it.

## Question 5
- The main method returns "X: 0 Y: 0"

## Question 6
- The private declaration for the variable and function means that only code within the same class can acess it, this achieves proper encapsulation, since outside code cannot acess it.

## Question 7
- Java chooses between the two constructors by looking at what parameters were given
  - If two doubles were given it uses the first definition
  - If a point was given it uses the second definition
 
## Question 8
- Option 4 is correct since it is the only option that entirely utilizes public methods, options 1,2,3, and 5 try to either set or get using code that is not available to them

## Question 9
