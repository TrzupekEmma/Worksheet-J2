  <li>What is a static Method</li>
    <ul>
    <li>A static method in java is a method that works on a static version of the object. </li>
    <li>This means that instead of using a constructor to make an object, and then altering it's values with a method
      You can simply run the method, and it alters the static variables</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Why is the main method static</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The main method needs to be static because there is no object created of the main class</li>
    <li>If you tried to call non static main without calling it on an object it would throw an error</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
